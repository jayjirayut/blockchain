### Blockchain: An Introduction
Welcome to my blockchain project! I created this project as a way to learn about the technology behind blockchain and gain a better understanding of how it works. Although I am not a professional blockchain developer, I am passionate about its potential to change the way we conduct transactions and manage data.

#### What is Blockchain?
Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that records transactions across a network of computers. The ledger is public and can be accessed by anyone with an internet connection. Each block in the chain contains a record of multiple transactions and is connected to the previous block through cryptographic hashes, creating a secure and tamper-proof record of all transactions.

#### Cryptocurrency and Blockchain
Cryptocurrency is a digital asset that is stored on a blockchain. Bitcoin, the first and most well-known cryptocurrency, was created in 2009 as a decentralized digital alternative to traditional fiat currencies. Today, there are thousands of different cryptocurrencies, each with its own unique features and use cases.

#### Cryptocurrency Wallet
A cryptocurrency wallet is a software application that stores your digital assets. It is a secure way to store your cryptocurrencies, and you can use it to send and receive digital assets, as well as view your transaction history.

#### Cryptocurrency Exchange
A cryptocurrency exchange is a platform that allows you to buy and sell cryptocurrencies. These platforms connect buyers and sellers of digital assets and facilitate the trading process. Some popular examples include Binance, Coinbase and Kraken

### Project Methodologies
In this project, I have used several different methods to build a functional blockchain. These include:

1. init: Initializes the class.
2. register_node: Registers a new node on the network.
3. valid_chain: Validates the blockchain.
4. resolve_conflicts: Resolves any conflicts that may occur.
5. new_block: Creates a new block.
6. new_transaction: Creates a new transaction.
7. last_block: Gets the last block.
8. hash: Gets the hash of the block.
9. proof_of_work: Gets the proof of work.
10. valid_proof: Validates the proof of work.
11. mine: Mines the block.
12. full_chain: Gets the full chain.
13. consensus: Resolves any conflicts that may occur.
